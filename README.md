# CMPM 121 Section 1 Activity

for this activity, it was pretty simple and easy to follow the instructions.
i did have trouble with the linting line, and found that it did cause problems with trying to git commit & push.
i found that by removing the line, i was able to commit & push.

aside from that hurdle, which i'm not entirely sure i was supposed to do, i think this activity was a good starter.
